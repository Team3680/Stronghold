# FIRST Stronghold (2016)
### Elemental Dragons, FRC Team 3680
The Elemental Dragons are a small robotics team from Statesville, North Carolina. More information about the team can be found on our [website](http://elementaldragons.org). This code, though it may have a few bugs and beginner's mistakes, was created by one team member with minimal outside help. We would love to receive some feedback in the form of either Pull Requests or Issues, if you see one that may be fixed.
### Program Details
This program is different from how many teams complete their programming. The programmer/electrician had to throw the majority of this together in a very small amount of time, though it was a learning experience unlike no other.
